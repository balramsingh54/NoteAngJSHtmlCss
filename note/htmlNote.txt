HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text

HTML links are hyperlinks.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: üòÑ üòç üíó

The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.

The <datalist> element specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element.
Users will see a drop-down list of the pre-defined options as they input data.

#box p:first-child  :- means first paragraph of box div select hua hai 
#box p:nth-child(3)    :- esase dusra paragraph select hoga

Wrap : it means kisi tag ko kisi dusre tag me add kr dena jaise
